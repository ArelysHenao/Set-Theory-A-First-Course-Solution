# Set-Theory-A-First-Course-Solution
The goal of this repository is to present solutions using logical calculus from Set Theory: A First Course by Daniel W. Cunningham.
## Steps
- I recommend starting by reviewing the theorems in the first file.
- The exercises are solved using logical calculus, so at the beginning of each chapter, I include my interpretation of the theorems from that section.
- The names of the theorems are currently written in Spanish (temporarily).
