# Metatheorems
### What is a Metatheorem?
A **metatheorem** is a theorem about a formal system itself, rather than about objects within the system. It concerns properties of the system's syntax, semantics, or proof rules.
We are going to use two of them.
## Deducion Metatheorems
The following theorem simplifies the amount of formal proof needed.
Defenition.
Let Γ a set of premises and noempty. If Γ, P ⊨ Q then Γ ⊨ P ⟹ Q.

I know this definition could be some hard to understand. Next I will give an example.
## Prove with Deducion Metatheorems this Theorem: ** P
